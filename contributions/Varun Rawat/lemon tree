I'm sittin' here in the boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time
I got nothin' to do
I'm hangin' around
I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I'm drivin' around in my car
I'm drivin' too fast
I'm drivin' too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely
I'm waitin' for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder
I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
And all that I can see is just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turnin' my head up and down
I'm turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin', turnin' around
And all that I can see is just another lemon tree
